          Hi! I am Rimika Dhara, a Computer Science/Data Science undergraduate student at the University 
          of Minnesota - Twin Cities.
      </p>
      <p>
          I was born and brought up Mumbai, India. I moved to the United States with my parents when I 
          was 14 years old in order to achieve better education opportunities. I am interested in a multitude 
          of different activities such as dance, painting, photography, and video editing.
      </p>
      <p>
          Amongst all of my hobbies, I am the most passionate about dance. I have been dancing for more than 15
          years, training in the Indian Classical dance style of Kathak. I have also been practicing several
          other dance styles such as hip hop, bhangra, contemporary, kuthu, and laavni. In my first year of college
          I joined a Bollywood Fusion Dance Team called Minnesota Junoon where I primarily practiced these styles. 
          Dance has been a huge part of my childhood and I am looking forward to further study and practice it in the 
          future.
      </p>

          I have also been involved in other organizations in my college. I am an Affiliate Liaison for the Indian Student 
          Association (ISA) and the Student Outreach Committee Director for the Science and Engineering Student Board (SESB). I have 
          been an active member of Engineering World Health and Women in Science and Engineering (WIE). I am also involved in research 
          through the Neuromodulation Research and Technology Lab where I am studying Parkinsons's Disease and trying to apply Machine
          Learning algorithms to equate the motor symptoms of the PD patients to their UPDRS scores.
      </p>
      <p>
          Overall, I am very passionate about everything I do and I am looking forward to learning more through this program. Thank you
          for this opportunity!
